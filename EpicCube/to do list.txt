brainstorm

things that worked

Main Board
	1.	recreate a footprint that will work for the larger connectors
	2.	change connector location on board layout.
	4.	create uC LED Heart Beat with spare holes

Temp Sense Board
	1. Verify Demux channels work correctly
	2. Write software for controlling demux

HVAC/Garage board
	1. Update PCB
	2.	Verify Optocouplers

Damper Board

Software

Computer Software
	1. Create Sockets to communication from python to server
	2. Create delegate system to control all of the different commands
	extra. create a library of audio that is tied to the responses instead of microsoft Sam

microController Software
(note while uC is being shipped develope code using GCC)
	1.	Create Sprinkler software
	2.	create a char lookup table 
	3. 	Create simple demux for temperature board
	4. 	Create software to sample HVAC signals
